Project description

## Usage/Examples

Example usage:

## How to compile/run

Simply use make to compile the program:

```bash
make -j
```

And then run the resulting binary, in this case, `my_ls`.
By default, the Makefile uses epiclang. To compile with something else, you can simply modify the value of CC like this:
```bash
make -j CC=gcc
```

## Running Tests

To execute the unit tests, use the tests_run rule, which will compile the tests and execute the resulting binary.

```bash
make -j tests_run
```
